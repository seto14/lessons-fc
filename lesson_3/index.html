						<p>For sport anglers, largemouth bass and smallmouth bass are two of the most prized catches. Bass
							spend most of their time in lakes and rivers with plentiful fresh water. </p>
						<p class="lesson">They tend to congregate in
							mossy, sheltered areas to prey on smaller fish, such as minnows.</p>
						<p>The best time to fish for bass is May through July, using minnows, crayfish, night
							crawlers, jigs,
							crank baits and spinner baits. Both live bait and artificial lures will attract bass, but one may
							be more attractive to smallmouth bass as opposed to largemouth bass.</p>
						<p>Early morning and late evening
							are the best time to catch bass as they tend to take shelter from the sun during the day. They are
							more active when the climate is cooler and the sun is not as bright.</p>
